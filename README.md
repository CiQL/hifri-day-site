# hifri.day

This was originally going to be a code mirror for the website hosted at https://hifri.day but then I decided to actually set the 
domain up to a GitHub page. Turns out: easier than it looks! A bit more inconvenient because I couldn't redirect subdomains, but 
since that already wasn't working on the previous host I figured it didn't really matter.
